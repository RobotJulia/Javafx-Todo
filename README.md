# Javafx-Todo

This is a simple todo list using Javafx and a single LocalEvent. The GUI is an interface between a MySQL database that handles Strings. There is no real security at the moment as it will integrate with another system that already has a login at a later date.

Please feel creative and add a background image to yours.
